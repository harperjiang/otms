					<p>Not every native speaker can be a good tutor. TutorCan knows
						that and choose the member of our tutor team carefully.</p>
					<p>Our tutors either major in Child Education and English from
						the best education college, or are primary school teachers that
						have many years of experiences of teaching kids English.</p>
					<p>Before joining the team, each tutor will be individually
						interviewed and evaluated by an experienced education expert to
						determine their eligibility. They will also receive periodically
						reviews to ensure the competence.</p>
					<p>Student feedback is another important factor for us to
						evaluate tutors' performance. Student can grade their tutors, give
						suggestions. We have a quality team to guarantee these feedbacks
						are handled by tutors in a timely manner.</p>
