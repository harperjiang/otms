				<p>Not every native speaker can be a good tutor. TutorCan knows
					that and choose the member of our tutor team carefully.</p>
				<p>Our tutors either major in Child Education and English from
					the best education college, or are primary school teachers that
					have many years of experiences of teaching kids English.</p>
				<p>Before joining the team, each tutor will be individually
					interviewed and evaluated by an experienced education expert to
					determine their eligibility. They will also receive periodically
					reviews to ensure the competence.</p>
				<p>Student feedback is another important factor for us to
					evaluate tutors' performance. Student can grade their tutors, give
					suggestions. We have a quality team to guarantee these feedbacks
					are handled by tutors in a timely manner.</p>
